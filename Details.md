Integrate Passkey technology with Lazorkit to 10x Solana UX

Goal

It is 2025 and blockchain UX no different from it were years ago when users still need to install a 3rd party wallet app and seed phrase is still a thing. Solana validator supported passkey algorithm since June 2025 and Lazorkit is one of library that enable users to use Solana without installing anything, however its adoptation is still very much limited.
Thus, this bounty’s goal is:

    To help other Solana developers get started with Lazorkit SDK by creating clear, practical integration examples and starter templates.

You don’t need to build a full product — just a high-quality example repo that demonstrates real-world usage of Lazorkit’s key features like passkey authentication and gasless smart wallet transactions.

Required Deliverables

    Working Example Repo

        Use one of these frameworks:

            Next.js (React)

            Vite (React)

            React Native (Expo)

        Clean repo with clear folder structure

        Well-documented code with comments

    Quick-Start Guide

        Clear README with:

            Project overview

            SDK installation & config

            Environment setup

            Instructions to run the example

    At Least 2 Step-by-Step Tutorials (can be in README or markdown files)

        E.g.:

            How to create a passkey-based wallet

            How to trigger a gasless transaction

            How to persist session across devices

        Bonus: publish the tutorials as blog posts or threads on X (Twitter)

    *Live Demo

        Deployed on Devnet with a working frontend

        Simple UI is fine — focus is on integration

💡 Suggested Examples

You can choose one or more of the following use cases:

    Passkey login flow with smart wallet

    Gasless USDC transfer on Solana Mainnet

    “Pay with Solana” widget

    React Native mobile onboarding with biometric login

    Basic token swap interface

    Subscription service with automated USDC billing on Solana (powered by smart wallet)

Or propose your own example, just ensure it clearly demonstrates Lazorkit integration.
